Project G6: Asteroid Impact Prediction

Team Members: Aditya Hishobkar, Deepika Sambrekar and Naghma Afreen

Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakhawat18/asteroid-dataset/data
Dataset contains information about Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), including their size, orbit, composition.

Goal 1: Identifying potentially dangerous asteroids, using ML algorithms to identify asteroids that are in orbits that intersect Earthâ€™s orbit and that are large enough to cause significant damage on impact.

Goal 2: Predicting the trajectory of asteroids, ML algorithms to predict the future trajectory of asteroids based on their current position and velocity.


Classifier&Trajectory: Contains steps for Data Preprocessing, Classifier Model and Trajectory evaluation.
